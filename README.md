Getting-and-Cleaning-Data Course Project

In this repository are the R code (run_analysis.R), this readme file, a code book
(Codebook.md) and the output .txt file (averagesdata.txt).

The Tidy data file "averagesdata.txt" is built from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones
Dataset, Version 1.0.  

Data are generated from 30 volunteers 19-48 years old where smartphones measure six acitivities - 
walking, walking_upstairs, walking_downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying.

run_analysis.R assumes that the files are downloaded to the working directory or file
paths accessible to that directory per the code in run_analysis.R.

Codebook.md describes the variables (columns), rows (), and files and processing in run_analysis.R
